Process receipts and deliveries in two steps
============================================

Depending on a company's business processes, multiple steps may be needed before receiving or
shipping products. In the two-step receipt process, products are received in an input area, then
transferred to stock. Two-step receipts work best when various storage locations are being used,
such as locked or secured areas, freezers and refrigerators, or various shelves.

Products can be sorted according to where they are going to be stored, and employees can stock all
the products going to a specific location. The products are not available for further processing
until they are transferred into stock.

In the two-step delivery process, products that are part of a delivery order are picked from the
warehouse according to their removal strategy, and brought to an output location before being
shipped.

One situation where this would be useful is when using either a :abbr:`FIFO (First In, First Out)`,
:abbr:`LIFO (Last In, First Out)`, or :abbr:`FEFO (First Expired, First Out)`  removal strategy,
where the products that are being picked need to be selected based on their receipt date or
expiration date.

Odoo is configured by default to :doc:`receive and deliver goods in one step
<receipts_delivery_one_step>`, so the settings need to be changed in order to utilize two-step
receipts and deliveries. Incoming and outgoing shipments do not need to be set to have the same
steps. For example, products can be received in two steps, but shipped in one step. In the following
example, two steps will be used for both receipts and deliveries.

Configuration
=============

First, make sure the :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` option is enabled in :menuselection:`Inventory
--> Configuration --> Settings --> Warehouse`. Note that activating :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes`
will also activate :guilabel:`Storage Locations`.

Next, the warehouse needs to be configured for two-step receipts and deliveries. Go to
:menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`, and click :guilabel:`Edit` to edit the
:guilabel:`Warehouse`. Then, select :guilabel:`Receive goods in input and then stock (2 steps)` for
:guilabel:`Incoming Shipments`, and :guilabel:`Send goods in output and then deliver (2 steps)` for
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments`. Then :guilabel:`Save` the changes.

Activating two-step receipts and deliveries will create a new :guilabel:`Input` and
:guilabel:`Output` location (:guilabel:`WH/Input, WH/Output`). To rename these locations, go to
:menuselection:`Configuration --> Locations`, select the :guilabel:`Location` to change, click
:guilabel:`Edit`, update the name, and finally, click :guilabel:`Save`.

Process a receipt in two steps (input + stock)
==============================================

Create a purchase order
-----------------------

In the :guilabel:`Purchase` application, create a new quote by clicking :guilabel:`Create`. Select a
:guilabel:`vVndor`, add a storable :guilabel:`Product`, and click :guilabel:`Confirm Order`.

A :guilabel:`Receipt` smart button will appear in the top right, and the receipt will be associated
with the purchase order. Clicking on the :guilabel:`Receipt` smart button will show the receipt
order.

Process a receipt
-----------------

The receipt and internal transfer will be created once the purchase order is confirmed. The status
of the receipt will be :guilabel:`Ready`, since the receipt must be processed first. The status of
the internal transfer will be :guilabel:`Waiting Another Operation`, since the transfer cannot
happen until the receipt is completed. The status of the internal transfer will only change to
:guilabel:`Ready` once the receipt has been marked as :guilabel:`Done`.

The receipt can also be found in the :guilabel:`Inventory` application. In the overview dashboard,
click the :guilabel:`1 To Process` smart button in the :guilabel:`Receipts` Kanban card.

Click on the :guilabel:`Receipt` associated with the purchase order, then click :guilabel:`Validate`
to complete the receipt and move the product to the :guilabel:`Input Location`.

   :alt: Validate the receipt by clicking Validate, then the product will be transferred to the
         WH/Input location.

Process an internal transfer
----------------------------

Once the product is in the :guilabel:`Input Location`, the internal transfer is ready to move the
product to :guilabel:`Stock`. In the inventory overview dashboard, click the :guilabel:`1 To
Process` smart button in the :guilabel:`Internal Transfers` Kanban card.

Click on the :guilabel:`Transfer` associated with the purchase order, then click
:guilabel:`Validate` to complete the receipt and move the product to :guilabel:`Stock`. Once the
transfer is validated, the product enters the stock and is available for customer deliveries or
manufacturing orders.

===================================================

Create a sales order
--------------------

In the :guilabel:`Sales` application, create a new quote by clicking :guilabel:`Create`. Select a
:guilabel:`Customer`, add a storable :guilabel:`Product`, and click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

A :guilabel:`Delivery` smart button will appear in the top right. Clicking on it will show both the
picking order and delivery order, which are both associated with the sales order.

   :alt: After confirming the sales order, the Delivery smart button appears showing two items
         associated with it.

Process a picking
-----------------

The picking and delivery order will be created once the sales order is confirmed. The status of the
picking will be :guilabel:`Ready`, since the product must be picked from stock before it can be
shipped. The status of the delivery order will be :guilabel:`Waiting Another Operation`, since the
delivery cannot happen until the picking is completed. The status of the delivery order will only
change to :guilabel:`Ready` once the picking has been marked as :guilabel:`Done`.

   :alt: Ready status for the pick operation while the delivery operation is Waiting Another
         Operation.

The receipt can also be found in the :guilabel:`Inventory` application. In the overview dashboard,
click the :guilabel:`1 To Process` smart button in the :guilabel:`Pick` Kanban card.

.. image:: receipts_delivery_two_steps/two-step-pick-kanban.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The pick order can be seen in the Inventory Kanban view.

Click on the :guilabel:`Picking` to process. If the product is in stock, Odoo will automatically
reserve the product. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to mark the picking as :guilabel:`Done`, then the
delivery order will be ready to be processed. Since the documents are linked, the products which
have been previously picked are automatically reserved on the delivery order.

Process a delivery
------------------

The delivery order will be ready to be processed once the picking is completed, and can be found in
the :guilabel:`Inventory` application overview dashboard. Click the :guilabel:`1 To Process` smart
button in the :guilabel:`Delivery Orders` Kanban card.

.. image:: receipts_delivery_two_steps/deliver-two-step-kanban.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The delivery order can be seen in the Inventory Kanban view.

Click on the :guilabel:`Delivery Order` associated with the :guilabel:`Sales Order`, then click on
:guilabel:`Validate` to complete the move.

   :align: center
   :alt: Click Validate on the delivery order to transfer the product from the output location to the
         customer location.

Once the delivery order is validated, the product leaves the :guilabel:`WH/Output` location and
moves to the :guilabel:`Partners/Customers` location. Then, the status of the document will change
to :guilabel:`Done`.
