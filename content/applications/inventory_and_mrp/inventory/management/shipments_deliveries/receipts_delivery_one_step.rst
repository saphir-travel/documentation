Process receipts and deliveries in one step
===========================================

By default, incoming shipments are configured to be received directly into stock, and outgoing
shipments are configured to be delivered directly from stock to the customer.

Incoming and outgoing shipments do not need to be configured with the same steps. For
example, products can be received in one step, but shipped in three steps. In the following example,
one step will be used for both receipts and deliveries.

Configuration
=============

If another receiving or shipping configuration is set on the warehouse, they can easily be set back
to one step. Begin by making sure that Odoo is configured to receive and deliver products in one
step. Go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`, click on the warehouse to
edit, then, click :guilabel:`Edit`. Select :guilabel:`Receive goods directly (1 step)` for
:guilabel:`Incoming Shipments` and :guilabel:`Deliver goods directly (1 step)` for
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments`, then :guilabel:`Save` the changes.
